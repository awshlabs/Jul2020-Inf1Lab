#Compile and Deploy a TensorFlow model on Inf1 instances


Amazon SageMaker now supports Inf1 instances for high performance and cost-effective inferences. Inf1 instances are ideal for large scale machine learning inference applications like image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing, personalization, and fraud detection. In this example, we train a classification model on the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow, compile it using Amazon SageMaker Neo, and deploy the model on Inf1 instances on a SageMaker endpoint and use the Neo Deep Learning Runtime to make inferences in real-time and with low latency.
